        <p class="heading">PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</p>
        <p class="para">Edelweiss Laboratories provides expert advice in new product development. New products need to be designed so as to ensure that they behave as they are intended to: they must have the required pharmacological affect and they must be are stable under given storage conditions. Edelweiss will develop samples of all products in accordance with the Client's directives. This process may include amongst others the choice of fragrance, the taste profile, the viscosity of semi-solid products, interactions with base materials or other active ingredients and the choice of preservative. Edelweiss will procure the services of top cosmetics formulators where necessary.</p>
        <p class="para">Once sample batches have been produced, further laboratory testing is called for. These tests include accelerated stability testing, preservative challenge testing and dissolution testing, with an option for product assay. We highly recommend preservative challenge testing for all liquids and semi-solids and refer these procedures to the SABS-recommended Merieux Laboratories for execution and certification. Procedures that are currently sub-contracted are HPLC and Gas Chromatography.</p>
        <p class="para">While samples are being tested and proved suitable for production, packaging is chosen for marketing aesthetics as well product stability. Edelweiss keeps a range of 'off-the-shelf' packaging and will point the client in the appropriate direction for a wider range.</p>
